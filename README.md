# uv2nix

This was an attempt to utilize [uv]() lockfile to convert Python packages to Nix packages to make it possible to use Nix as a Python package manager.

Unfortunately, Python packaging itself is really complicated and converting them to Nix packages is even more complicated due to the Python packaging mess.

Therefore, this project is dead.
